# Linux Jeopardy CTF – Single VM Challenge

## Overview
This challenge is a Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag (CTF) conducted on a single Linux virtual machine.  
Participants are provided only with the VM image and must explore, enumerate, and exploit the system to discover hidden flags.

The system contains **10 flags**, each designed to test different Linux, enumeration, privilege escalation, and forensic skills.

No usernames or passwords are provided.  
All access must be obtained through analysis and exploitation of the system itself.

## Objective
- Gain access to the Linux system
- Enumerate services, files, and permissions
- Escalate privileges where required
- Locate and submit all **10 valid flags**


Flags follow the format:

## Scope & Rules
- Only the provided virtual machine is in scope
- Internet access is not required
- Brute forcing is discouraged
- Denial of service or destructive actions are not permitted

---

## Difficulty
**Easy-Intermediate**  
Basic Linux knowledge is required. Some flags may require advanced enumeration and privilege escalation techniques.

## Deliverables
- Virtual Machine file (OVA)
- This README
- Flag submission platform (external)
